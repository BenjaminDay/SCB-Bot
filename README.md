This project is primarily to create a bot that can interact with an android emulator (Nox in this case) and remove the need for human interaction on repetitive tasks.

While it is designed to work for Sim City Buildit in mind, 
the code is written in a way that can be adapted to work for other games with some minimal changes to main.py and also, 
by replacing the images the bot uses as reference for buttons etc.
